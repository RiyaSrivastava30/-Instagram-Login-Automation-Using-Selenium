## Notes
1. **Security**: Do not hard-code sensitive information like passwords in the script. Use environment variables or secure credential storage solutions for production use.
2. **Instagram's Policies**: Ensure that your use of automation scripts complies with Instagramâ€™s terms of service.
3. **Dynamic Selectors**: Instagram frequently updates its web elements. You might need to update the script if the element locators change.
